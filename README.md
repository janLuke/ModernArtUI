This is the first app I made from scratch. Nothing useful here, but it was funny to build it! It's basically a "modern art" generator that allows you to randomly create "artworks" composed from several colored rectangles.

I made it as an assignment of the Coursera's course "Programming Mobile Application for Android Handheld Systems: Part 1". The actual assignment was much more simple. I tried to make it a little more interesting.

A video of the first functioning version can be find at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBaijyBY-Mg.
