# What is it?

This is the first Android app I made from scratch. I made it as the final assignment of the
Coursera's course "Programming Mobile Application for Android Handheld Systems: Part 1", but it's a
more complex version of what was assigned to do: the original assignment was to build a
fixed layout showing an "artwork"; I made a generator of "artworks" that you can save as png.

All the constraints of the original assignment were respected: each artwork has at least a white
tile whose color cannot be changed.

Here's a screenshot:

The three sliders allow you to set:

* the color saturation (white rectangles remain white as of assignment constraint),
* the black stroke width 
* the "granularity" of the artwork (technically, the  maximum depth of the tree representing the
artwork).

You can also randomly recolor the artwork globally or shift the hue of an individual rectangle
(except white rectangles) clicking on it.

Here's a video of me "manually testing" the app (the video is longer than it should be):
